# Employmint


Employmint is the mobile solution for teenagers seeking entry level employment. First place winner at AlphaHacks.

Employmint is an Android application that I developed using Android Studio, Java, XML, Firebase Database, and the Indeed API. 

Screenshots of the device flow are shown below:

3. Job Panel

Version 2.0 will have many great features that can help us transition into a more global business environment:

-An employer's portal, allowing employers to post job descriptions and sign up for their own advertising packages.
-A career quiz, allowing students to get a head start on what jobs they'd enjoy doing.
-Transportation options based on the user's location and the location of the job. This is useful because many teenagers use public transport as their primary way of transportation.
-Favouriting or starring jobs users want to view at a later date.
