# Employmint


Employmint is the mobile solution for teenagers seeking entry level employment. First place winner at AlphaHacks.

Employmint is an online job network that is built for teenagers (14-18) in the GTA. It filters jobs by location, compensation and working hours and pulls from regional data to see available job postings.

The application was developed using Android Studio, Java, XML, Firebase Database, and the Indeed API. 

Screenshots of the device flow are shown below:

3. Job Panel

Version 2.0 will have many great features that can help us transition into a more global business environment:

1. An employer's portal, allowing employers to post job descriptions and sign up for their own advertising packages.
2. A career quiz, allowing students to get a head start on what jobs they'd enjoy doing.
3. Transportation options based on the user's location and the location of the job. This is useful because many teenagers use public transport as their primary way of transportation.
4. Favouriting or starring jobs users want to view at a later date.
